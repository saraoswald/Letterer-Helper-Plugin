1.1	Caption:	It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
	Mrs. Bennet: 	My dear Mr. Bennet,
		have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?
	Mr. Bennet:	I had not.
	Mrs. Bennet: 	But it is,
		for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.
	Mrs. Bennet:	Do not you want to know who has taken it?
	Mr. Bennet:	You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.
		What is his name?
	Mrs. Bennet:	Bingley.
	Mr. Bennet:	Is he married or single?
	Mrs. Bennet: 	A single man of large fortune—four or five thousand a year.
	Mrs. Bennet/aside:	What a fine thing for our girls! ☆
	Mr. Bennet: 	How so? how can it affect them?
1.4	Mrs. Bennet: 	You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.
	Mrs. Bennet/aside:	You have no compassion on my poor nerves.
	Mr. Bennet: 	You mistake me, my dear. 
		I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends.
		I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.
1.5	Mr. Bennet: 	But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.
	Mrs. Bennet: 	It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them.
	Mr. Bennet:	Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.
